Hi [Name],

I'm a Staff-level engineer with 20+ years experience, most recently 
building real-time distributed systems at Walmart scale (think millions 
of requests/sec). 

I'm now focused on AI infrastructure - I'm actually in the top 2% of 
Cursor AI users, so I've been living and breathing AI-native development.

Looking for Staff/Principal roles in AI infrastructure, model serving, 
or AI platform engineering. Fully remote preferred.

Would love to connect if you're working on any relevant searches.

Best,
[Your name]
