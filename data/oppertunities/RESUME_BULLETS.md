## Don't Oversell, Do Translate

❌ **Don't claim ML experience you don't have**
```
"Built machine learning models for traffic prediction"
(Unless you actually did this)
```

✅ **Do translate your experience authentically**
```
"Built the real-time data infrastructure that powered ML-driven 
personalization systems, enabling sub-100ms feature serving at scale"
```

The goal is showing how your **existing expertise** solves **AI infrastructure problems**, not pretending you're a data scientist.
