## 2. About Section (2,600 characters max)

```
Staff Engineer with 30+ years building production systems, including 4+ years at Walmart Global Tech architecting real-time scoring and inference-style systems at internet scale.

🎯 WHAT I BUILD

At Walmart, I lead architecture of systems that mirror ML infrastructure patterns:

• Real-time scoring systems processing millions of events with sub-second latency
• Multi-signal feature aggregation (geolocation, behavior, device fingerprinting)
• Closed-loop automation: score → action → feedback pipelines
• MLOps-style orchestration with automated deployment, rollback, and approval gates
• Internal platform engineering that abstracts infrastructure complexity

These are the exact patterns AI/ML platforms require — I've been building them at scale for years.

🛠️ TECH STACK

Golang, Python, Kafka, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, Memcached, Cassandra, Akamai, Grafana, React.js, GraphQL

☁️ INFRASTRUCTURE

• Kubernetes (WCNP) migration — containerizing distributed services
• Edge computing with Akamai/Torbit for real-time traffic processing
• High-availability architecture (99.99% uptime at Walmart scale)

🤖 AI-NATIVE DEVELOPMENT

• Top 2% Cursor AI user globally — AI-assisted development is my daily workflow
• Integrating LLM APIs into internal tooling
• Evangelizing AI adoption across engineering teams

📜 PATENT HOLDER

US Patent 10,078,968: System and Method for Electronic Test Delivery — distributed coordination system for secure, reliable operations at scale.

🔍 WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

Staff/Principal Engineer roles in:
• AI Infrastructure
• ML Platform Engineering  
• LLM Serving / Inference Systems
• Distributed Systems

📍 Fully remote only (US-based)

Let's connect if you're building AI systems that need production-grade infrastructure expertise.
