## Professional Experience

### Staff Technical Expert
**Walmart Global Tech, InfoSec** | Herndon, VA | March 2020 – Present

Leading architecture of **ML-like scoring systems** and **real-time inference pipelines** protecting Walmart's e-commerce at internet scale. Building the exact infrastructure patterns used by AI/ML platforms.

**Real-Time Scoring & Inference Systems** *(ML Infrastructure Patterns)*

- **Counting System** — Real-time anomaly detection system using distributed feature aggregation
  - Tech: Golang, Memcache, SQL Server, Splunk, Grafana
  - **ML Pattern:** Streaming feature aggregation + threshold-based scoring (like real-time ML inference)
  - Processes internet-scale traffic patterns with sub-second latency for instant bot detection
  - Horizontally scalable architecture — same patterns used for distributed model serving

- **EIS Event Queue** — Multi-signal scoring system for high-traffic events (Black Friday scale)
  - Tech: Golang, Kafka, Memcache, MaxMind, Spur
  - **ML Pattern:** Real-time feature engineering from multiple data sources → scoring → action
  - Feature signals: geolocation (MaxMind), proxy/VPN detection (Spur), cookies, user agent, account flags
  - Real-time ticket scoring ensuring legitimate customers pass, bots filtered — like fraud ML models

- **IntelDb** — Real-time threat scoring and intelligence system
  - Tech: Golang, Akamai SIEM streaming, SQL Server, REST APIs
  - **ML Pattern:** Streaming inference pipeline with feedback loop
  - Real-time IP scoring based on traffic behavior patterns (like anomaly detection models)
  - Closed-loop automation: scores feed back to Akamai for action — model prediction → action pattern

- **Account Takeover (ATO) WebService** — Real-time account risk API
  - Tech: Node.js, Kafka, Splunk, OpenObserve
  - **ML Pattern:** Event-driven inference serving with Kafka backbone
  - Instant account flagging/reset based on risk signals — like real-time fraud scoring APIs

**MLOps-Style Orchestration & Platform Engineering**

- **Event Automation** — Automated rule deployment platform (like ML model deployment)
  - Tech: Golang, GraphQL, React.js, Memcache, Torbit, Slack APIs
  - **ML Pattern:** Automated model/rule rollout with approval gates and rollback
  - Multi-market orchestration across 4 regions — like multi-region model deployments
  - Auto-pilot mode with scheduled activation — like automated model retraining pipelines
  - PR-based approval workflow — model governance pattern
  - Mission control dashboard — ML observability pattern

- **EIS Team Portal + Workflow Manager** — Internal ML Platform-style developer experience
  - Tech: React.js, Golang, Python, SQL Server, Grafana, REST APIs
  - **ML Pattern:** Platform that abstracts infrastructure complexity for engineers
  - Script orchestration with centralized secrets — like MLflow/Kubeflow job management
  - Unified data access layer — like feature store access patterns
  - Engineers focus on logic, platform handles scheduling/logging/credentials — ML platform UX

- **ELSA** — Distributed search platform (Vector DB-adjacent patterns)
  - Tech: Golang, Elasticsearch cluster, SQL Server, React.js
  - **ML Pattern:** Distributed indexing and retrieval at scale — like vector search systems
  - Handles massive log datasets — similar capacity planning to embedding stores

**AI-Native Development & Leadership**

- Pioneered **AI-assisted development** across team, achieving **top 2% Cursor AI usage globally**
- Integrated **LLM APIs** into internal tooling for automated analysis and report generation
- Driving **WCNP (Kubernetes) migration** — containerizing services for ML-ready infrastructure
- Mentoring engineers on **AI-augmented workflows** and **prompt engineering** for productivity
- Evangelizing AI adoption: reduced development cycle time through AI pair programming
