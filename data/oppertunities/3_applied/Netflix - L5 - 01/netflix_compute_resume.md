## Experience

### Staff Technical Expert
**Walmart Global Tech** | Herndon, VA | March 2020 – Present

Building critical platform services and leading infrastructure modernization for Walmart's e-commerce platform. My focus is making reliable, scalable infrastructure that other engineers can depend on.

**Kubernetes & Container Platform Work:**

**WCNP Migration Lead** — Leading Kubernetes adoption at Walmart
- Leading containerization of multiple production services to Walmart Cloud Native Platform (Kubernetes)
- Architecting migration strategy: assessment → containerization → deployment → monitoring
- Working through real challenges: stateful services, service discovery, secrets management, observability
- Building tooling and runbooks to make container deployment self-service for other teams
- This is hands-on work - I'm writing Dockerfiles, K8s manifests, Helm charts, debugging pod issues

**Platform Engineering (Engineers are My Customers):**

**Team Portal & Workflow Manager** — Internal platform serving 50+ engineers
- React.js frontend, Golang/Python backend
- Platform philosophy: engineers write logic, platform handles infrastructure
- Self-service workflows for deployments, data access, job scheduling
- Centralized secrets management, unified logging, automated alerting
- Cut time-to-production by 60% - this is the kind of "set it and forget it" platform Netflix wants
- Engineers don't need to know infrastructure details - platform abstracts complexity

**Event Automation Platform** — Deployment orchestration system
- Multi-region rollout orchestration across 4 markets
- Features: approval workflows, staged deployments, instant rollback, scheduled runs
- Built "mission control" dashboard for deployment observability
- Think of it like a simple platform for automated deployments with governance

**Critical Tier0 Services at Scale:**

**Distributed Feature Aggregation System**
- Processes millions of events/second with sub-second latency (p99 ~100ms)
- Stack: Golang microservices, Kafka, Memcache, SQL Server
- Horizontally scalable - can add nodes to handle 10x traffic
- 99.99% uptime SLA - this is Tier0 reliability for Walmart e-commerce
- Full observability: real-time dashboards, automated alerts, distributed tracing

**Multi-Signal Scoring Pipeline**
- Event-driven architecture handling Black Friday traffic (10x normal load)
- Stack: Golang, Kafka event backbone, Memcache, REST APIs
- Real-time processing with strict latency requirements
- Multi-region deployment with failover capabilities

**Account Risk API** — Low-latency serving layer
- Node.js microservice serving millions of requests/day
- p99 latency under 50ms, 99.99% uptime
- Event-driven with Kafka for async processing
- Full observability and alerting

**Distributed Search Platform (ELSA)**
- Elasticsearch cluster for massive datasets
- Stack: Golang, Elasticsearch, SQL Server, React.js
- Similar capacity planning and performance optimization as container orchestration

**Operational Excellence:**
- On-call rotation - debug production issues, write post-mortems, automate fixes
- Built comprehensive monitoring for all services: metrics, logs, traces, alerts
- All my systems run at 99.99% uptime because reliability is built in from day one
- Mentor 8 engineers, run design reviews, set technical standards

### Principal Software Engineer / Engineering Lead
**Law School Admission Council (LSAC)** | Newtown, PA | November 1996 – March 2020

Built distributed systems and production platforms over two decades.

**Distributed Test Platform** — Got a patent for this (US 10,078,968)
- Coordinated thousands of simultaneous users across iOS, Android, Windows
- Real-time state synchronization at scale
- Similar orchestration challenges to container platforms

**SSO Platform** — Identity system with Azure AD B2C
- Custom auth framework with distributed microservices
- Multi-region deployment for reliability

**Data Sync Services** — Real-time integration pipelines
- Dynamics 365, Oracle, SQL Server, Salesforce
- CDC patterns, event-driven architecture

**ML Production Systems** — Early ML infrastructure
- Recommendation engine with microservices architecture
- OCR pipeline for document processing at scale

## Why This Role?

I'm in the middle of leading Kubernetes adoption at Walmart, building the platform thinking and operational rigor this role needs. I've built internal platforms where engineers are my customers - they focus on features, I handle infrastructure reliability. My services run at 99.99% uptime because I design for failure and build observability into every layer.

What I bring:
- Active Kubernetes migration experience (hands-on, right now)
- Platform engineering - built self-service platforms engineers love
- Tier0 operational excellence - I know what it takes to keep critical services running
- Distributed systems at internet scale
- Cross-functional leadership - I can drive alignment across teams

What I'm excited to learn:
- Netflix's container platform at truly massive scale (millions of containers)
- Hybrid cloud/on-prem orchestration challenges
- Managing hundreds of millions in compute capacity
- Netflix's specific tooling and operational practices

I'm looking for fully remote Staff/Senior roles. Compensation target around $300K-$500K total comp.
