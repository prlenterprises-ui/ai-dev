Hi Netflix Compute team,

I'm applying for the Engineer role on the Compute Control Plane & Capacity team. I'm currently in the middle of leading a Kubernetes migration at Walmart, and reading your job description made me realize this is exactly the kind of work I want to be doing full-time.

**Where I am today:**

For the past 4 years at Walmart, I've been building platform services that handle internet-scale traffic. But more importantly, I've been leading our migration to Kubernetes (WCNP - Walmart Cloud Native Platform). This isn't just strategy work - I'm hands-on writing Dockerfiles, debugging pod issues, figuring out secrets management, building monitoring. I'm living the containerization challenges right now.

At the same time, I've built internal platforms where other engineers are my customers. My Team Portal handles 50+ engineers who don't need to understand infrastructure details - they write code, the platform handles deployment, secrets, logging, alerting. Time-to-production dropped 60%. This is the "set it and forget it" philosophy you're looking for.

All my services run at 99.99% uptime because I build reliability in from the start: comprehensive monitoring, automated alerts, runbooks for failure scenarios, distributed tracing. I know what Tier0 means - at Walmart, if my services go down, e-commerce stops. That's the same bar Netflix has.

**What gets me excited about this role:**

The hybrid cloud/on-prem orchestration challenge is fascinating. I've done cloud (Azure, AWS) and I'm deep in Kubernetes now, but orchestrating across both is the next frontier. That's a hard problem worth solving.

Managing compute capacity at Netflix scale - millions of containers, hundreds of millions in spend - is a different level than what I've done. I want to work on problems where the scale forces you to think differently. Where you can't just throw more resources at it.

The platform engineering aspect resonates deeply. When you said "other engineers are your customers," that's exactly how I think. My job is to make infrastructure invisible so product engineers can move fast. That's what I've been doing at Walmart, and I want to do it at Netflix scale.

**What I need to be honest about:**

My Kubernetes experience is still growing. I'm not someone who's run K8s at Netflix scale for years. I'm leading a migration right now, learning as I go, building expertise. But I learn fast - I'm a top 2% Cursor AI user because I embrace new tech quickly.

I haven't done hybrid cloud/on-prem orchestration yet. That's new territory. But I've orchestrated multi-region deployments across 4 markets at Walmart, so I understand the coordination challenges. The platform is different, but the distributed systems thinking is the same.

I haven't managed compute capacity at hundreds-of-millions scale. My experience has been more on the application/platform side. But I understand cost optimization, resource efficiency, and how to build systems that scale horizontally.

**Why Netflix?**

Your culture of freedom and responsibility is exactly what I need. At Walmart, I've had full ownership of architecture decisions - I thrive when trusted to make technical calls and balance them with operational accountability.

The Compute team's mission - building foundational infrastructure that developers can rely on - is compelling. You're not building features, you're building the platform that makes features possible. That's the leverage I want.

I've read your blog posts (Region Evacuation, Titus, Noisy Neighbor Detection with eBPF) - the engineering rigor is impressive. You're solving problems most companies never hit. I want to work on those problems.

**What I bring:**

I've been doing Staff-level work at Walmart: setting technical direction, running design reviews, driving alignment across teams. I can break down complex problems, communicate progress to diverse stakeholders, and drive initiatives to completion.

I have deep ownership mentality. I take pride in delivering systems that run for years with minimal intervention. I build monitoring, write runbooks, train teams on operational best practices.

I'm comfortable with ambiguity. When requirements are vague, I prototype to make ideas concrete. I drive toward decisions even when it's outside my wheelhouse.

I'm selfless about what's best for the platform. At Walmart, I've made time to help other teams succeed because platform engineering is about enabling others.

**Ready to contribute:**

I'm not claiming to be a Kubernetes expert who's done this at Netflix scale. I'm someone in the middle of a K8s journey, building platform thinking and operational excellence, who wants to take that to the next level at Netflix. I learn quickly, I care deeply about reliability, and I know how to build platforms that engineers love.

I'd like to talk more about how my platform engineering experience and operational rigor can help Netflix Compute scale and innovate.

Thanks for considering my application.

P.S. I'm looking for fully remote work. Compensation-wise, I'm targeting $300K-$500K total comp, which fits within your range. Flexible on salary vs. stock - I want to be invested in Netflix's success.
