### CORE PHILOSOPHY: AUTONOMOUS GENERATION
You MUST generate a complete, compelling cover letter WITHOUT asking for additional information. Use the data provided to synthesize motivation, achievements, and company alignment.

### WORKFLOW: CRAFTING THE NARRATIVE

**Step 0: Extract Narrative Intelligence from Resume (FOUNDATION)**

Before crafting the cover letter, analyze the tailored resume's "narrative_context" fields to extract mission-aligned stories:

**For each relevant experience, identify:**
1. **Mission-aligned stories**: Which technical_story elements connect to company's mission and domain?
   - **Aerospace/Space company** → reliability, uptime, scale, failure handling, mission-critical systems stories
   - **Fintech/Banking** → security, compliance, data integrity, transaction processing stories
   - **Healthcare/Medical** → privacy, accuracy, life-critical systems, regulatory compliance stories
   - **Enterprise SaaS** → scalability, multi-tenancy, performance optimization stories
   - **Startup/High-growth** → rapid iteration, ownership, wearing multiple hats stories

2. **Authentic passion signals**: What challenges_overcome show genuine interest in this domain or problem space?

3. **Leadership context**: What leadership_story elements align with the company's cultural_values from research?

4. **Technical depth**: What technologies_deep_dive details add credibility beyond surface-level mentions?

**Use this intelligence to:**
- Craft hook that references authentic passion from challenges_overcome or impact_story
- Build bridge using impact_story to show personal motivation aligns with company mission
- Enhance proof_points with narrative context to transform generic achievements into mission-aligned stories
- Add technical depth from technologies_deep_dive where relevant to show mastery

**Example transformation:**
- **Generic**: "Reduced API latency by 40% serving 50K users"
- **Mission-aligned (Aerospace)**: "Architected event-driven systems with 99.9% uptime serving 50K users—applying the reliability-first mindset required for mission-critical systems where failure isn't an option"
- **Mission-aligned (Healthcare)**: "Built HIPAA-compliant data pipeline processing 50K patient records—implementing the same privacy and accuracy standards required for life-critical healthcare systems"

**Step 1: Leverage Pre-Generated Storytelling Arc (PRIMARY STRUCTURE)**
- **CRITICAL**: You have been provided with [STORYTELLING_ARC] - a pre-crafted narrative structure
- **USE THIS AS YOUR FOUNDATION**:
  1. **hook**: Use this as the basis for your opening paragraph
  2. **bridge**: Use this to craft the motivation paragraph
  3. **proof_points**: These are your 2-3 achievement paragraphs (already selected for maximum impact)
  4. **vision**: Use this for the technical alignment paragraph
  5. **call_to_action**: Use this for your closing paragraph
- **AUTHENTICITY RULE**: Expand on these elements naturally, don't just copy verbatim
- **STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE**: This arc was generated using deep job resonance and company research

**Step 2: Integrate Company Research (CULTURAL ALIGNMENT)**
- **CRITICAL**: You have been provided with [COMPANY_RESEARCH] - pre-analyzed company intelligence
- **USE THIS DATA STRATEGICALLY**:
  1. **mission_statement**: Reference this when explaining motivation
  2. **core_values**: Frame achievements to align with these values
  3. **tech_stack**: Mention relevant technologies from this list
  4. **culture_keywords**: Incorporate these naturally throughout
- **AUTHENTICITY RULE**: Only use research data where it genuinely enhances the narrative

**Step 3: Apply Job Resonance Intelligence (LANGUAGE MIRRORING)**
- **CRITICAL**: You have been provided with [JOB_RESONANCE_ANALYSIS] - pre-analyzed JD intelligence
- **USE THIS DATA STRATEGICALLY**:
  1. **emotional_keywords**: Incorporate these culture-signaling words naturally
  2. **cultural_values**: Ensure achievements demonstrate these values
  3. **power_verbs**: Use these action verbs when describing your work
- **AUTHENTICITY RULE**: Only use resonance keywords where they accurately describe your experience

**Step 4: Structure the Cover Letter (6 Paragraphs, 350-400 words)**

**PARAGRAPH 1: OPENING (2-3 sentences)**
- **USE [STORYTELLING_ARC].hook AS YOUR FOUNDATION**
- State who you are, what position you're applying for, and one compelling fact
- Incorporate an emotional_keyword from [JOB_RESONANCE_ANALYSIS] if it fits naturally
- Example: "I am [First Name] [Last Name], a full-stack software engineer with proven expertise in cloud infrastructure and scalable system design, applying for the [Job Title] position at [COMPANY_NAME]."

**PARAGRAPH 2: MOTIVATION (2-3 sentences)**
- **USE [STORYTELLING_ARC].bridge AS YOUR FOUNDATION**
- Explain why you're specifically interested in this company and role
- Reference [COMPANY_RESEARCH].mission_statement or core_values
- Connect to candidate's technical interests and career goals using cultural_values from [JOB_RESONANCE_ANALYSIS]

**PARAGRAPH 3: ACHIEVEMENT #1 (3-4 sentences)**
- **USE [STORYTELLING_ARC].proof_points[0] AS YOUR FOUNDATION**
- Present first quantified achievement from tailored resume
- Use STAR format: Context → Action → Result with specific numbers
- Mirror power_verbs from [JOB_RESONANCE_ANALYSIS]
- Link explicitly to a job requirement

**PARAGRAPH 4: ACHIEVEMENT #2 (3-4 sentences)**
- **USE [STORYTELLING_ARC].proof_points[1] AS YOUR FOUNDATION**
- Present second quantified achievement from tailored resume
- Focus on different skill set than paragraph 3
- Include specific technologies from [COMPANY_RESEARCH].tech_stack where relevant
- Show broader impact or growth aligned with cultural_values

**PARAGRAPH 5: TECHNICAL ALIGNMENT (2-3 sentences)**
- **USE [STORYTELLING_ARC].vision AS YOUR FOUNDATION**
- Demonstrate mastery of critical technical skills mentioned in job description
- Reference specific technologies from [COMPANY_RESEARCH].tech_stack
- Show understanding of role's technical challenges and how you'll contribute

**PARAGRAPH 6: CLOSING (2 sentences)**
- **USE [STORYTELLING_ARC].call_to_action AS YOUR FOUNDATION**
- Express confidence and enthusiasm using emotional_keywords from [JOB_RESONANCE_ANALYSIS]
- Call to action: "I'm excited to contribute to [COMPANY_NAME]'s mission and look forward to discussing how my experience aligns with your team's goals."
- Sign off with "Best regards," on its own line, followed by a blank line, then the candidate's full name on a new line

### CRITICAL WRITING PRINCIPLES

**1. SHOW, DON'T TELL**
- BAD: "I'm skilled in Python and cloud architecture"
- GOOD: "By architecting an AWS Lambda-based ETL pipeline processing 2M+ records daily, I reduced processing time by 99%"

**2. USE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND RESULTS**
- Every achievement must include quantified impact (percentages, dollar amounts, time saved, scale)
- Example metrics: "reduced by 80%", "processing 500K events/sec", "serving 100K daily users"

**3. MIRROR JOB DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE**
- Use exact terminology from the job posting
- If they mention "microservices", reference microservices in your examples
- If they emphasize "scalability", highlight your scalable system designs

**4. AVOID GENERIC STATEMENTS**
- BAD: "I'm a team player with excellent communication skills"
- GOOD: "I've led cross-functional teams to deliver cloud infrastructure solutions serving 100K+ users"

**5. CONFIDENT, ASSERTIVE TONE**
- Use strong verbs: "architected", "engineered", "designed", "led", "built"
- Avoid hedging: "I believe I might" → "I will"
- Stay humble: focus on team impact and learning

**6. COMPANY-SPECIFIC, NOT GENERIC**
- Every sentence should be tailored to THIS company and THIS role
- Reference company's specific mission, products, or engineering challenges
- If you could swap the company name and it still works, it's too generic

**7. NO EM DASHES**
- NEVER use em dashes (—) to join sentences, show impact, or create emphasis
- Use alternative punctuation: commas for pauses, semicolons for related clauses, periods for separate thoughts
- Use conjunctions (and, but, while) for connecting ideas
- Example: 
  - BAD: "Reduced processing time by 99%—from 3 months to 4 minutes"
  - GOOD: "Reduced processing time by 99%, from 3 months to 4 minutes"

**8. CRITICAL ATS COMPATIBILITY**
- NEVER use these characters anywhere in the cover letter: `<` `>` `[` `]` `{` `}` `\` `|` `~` `^`
- These characters break ATS parsing systems like Workday
- Use parentheses `()` instead of brackets/braces where needed
- Use commas or semicolons instead of pipes
- Avoid special symbols entirely in all text

### OUTPUT FORMAT: PLAIN TEXT ONLY

Return ONLY the cover letter body text - NO analysis, NO explanations, NO meta-commentary.

Your response should:
- Start with "Dear [Company Name] Hiring Team," (or "Dear Hiring Manager,")
- Be exactly 6 paragraphs separated by blank lines
- End with "Best regards," on one line, then a blank line, then the candidate's full name ([First Name] [Last Name]) on the next line
- Include NO date, location, email, or phone number
- Be between 350-400 words total (STRICT LIMIT)
- Be ready to copy and paste directly into an application
- CRITICAL: NEVER use em dashes (—) anywhere in the cover letter. Use commas, semicolons, periods, or conjunctions instead.

### MANDATORY PRE-OUTPUT VALIDATION

**STEP 1: COUNT WORDS**
- Count total words in your cover letter (excluding signature)
- If word count > 400: STOP and condense until ≤ 400
- Count every single word, including articles (a, the), prepositions, and conjunctions

**STEP 2: VERIFY QUALITY**
- [ ] Does opening clearly state position and one compelling fact?
- [ ] Does motivation section reference company-specific details from company research?
- [ ] Do both achievements include concrete numbers and quantified results?
- [ ] Have I mirrored 3-5 key phrases from the job description?
- [ ] Is every sentence focused on value to the company?
- [ ] Have I avoided generic statements and jargon?
- [ ] Is total length 350-400 words? (MUST BE YES)
- [ ] Does it read like a confident professional pitch, not an autobiography?

**STEP 3: FINAL VERIFICATION**
- Recount words one final time
- Confirm: Word count is between 350-400 (MUST BE ≤ 450)
- Only output if this is TRUE

DO NOT OUTPUT until word count is verified to be ≤ 450 words. This is MANDATORY.

Now generate the cover letter following these specifications exactly.
